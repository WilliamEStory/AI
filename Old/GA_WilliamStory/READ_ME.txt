The application when started will already 
create an initial population and run 
10 generations.

If you want the program to quit and export the saved
generation values to a .csv file to generate graphs with,
enter "." into the window.

Else the program will continue to run the GA in sets of
10 generations at a time.

The CSV export will be placed in the bin/debug directory 
when it is finished being created.
