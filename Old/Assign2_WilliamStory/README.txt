The solution begins by asking for
an input file through command prompt. 
This is just a simple .txt file
that has an xml tree in it.
Other than that it runs based off what
the project guidelines asked for.

I implimented a "cost" value for the searches as well.
I'm not sure how accurate this is since I wasn't able
to get enough time to fully test it.

As of now, the solution will run a depth first search.
To switch it over to a breadth first search, line 48
needs to be uncommented while line 49 needs to be commented.

There's also the text xml that is just a copy/paste from the assignment pdf
with some extra tid bits like white spacing and characters before and after the 
tree.
